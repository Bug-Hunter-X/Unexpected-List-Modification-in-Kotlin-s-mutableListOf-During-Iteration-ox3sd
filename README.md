This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Kotlin related to modifying a mutable list while iterating over it using the `removeIf` function. The `bug.kt` file shows the code that produces the unexpected behavior, and `bugSolution.kt` provides a corrected version.  This bug is subtle and can be difficult to track down, highlighting the importance of careful list manipulation in Kotlin.
